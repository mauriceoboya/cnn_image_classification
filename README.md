## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a neural network-based image classification system. Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and neural networks have shown remarkable performance in this domain. In this project, we will walk you through the process of training and evaluating a neural network model to classify images into predefined categories.
